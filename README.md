# HMEQ Predictive Modeling  
### Tree-Based Models • Regression Models • Neural Networks

This repository contains three predictive modeling assignments completed for my Practical Machine Learning course.  
All projects analyze the **Home Equity Line of Credit (HMEQ)** dataset, which includes customer financial attributes, loan performance, and two target variables:

- **TARGET_BAD_FLAG** — Indicates whether the loan defaulted (1 = default, 0 = repaid)
- **TARGET_LOSS_AMT** — The dollar amount lost when a default occurred

Each assignment explores a different family of machine-learning algorithms.  
Interactive HTML notebooks and final PDF reports are included.
